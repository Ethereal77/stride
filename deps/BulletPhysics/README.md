## BulletPhysics

This folder houses bullet, the physics engine used by `Stride.Physics` assembly.

* `libbulletc.*` is the bullet C++ library, we should have one lib compiled for each platform and architecture.

* `BulletSharp.NetStandard.dll` is the C# wrapper around that C++ library, there's one DLL for every platform.
